# Drive-Manager-for-Linux
I wanted to make an Terminal based (probably making a gui version of it later) Drive Manager with many funktions
This is for Linux systems only

## Functions
Here are all fuctions that are or will be added in the future 
1. List all Drives connected                                 -> in development
2. Format Drives                                             -> in development
3. Encrypt/Decrypt Drives (this is very dangerious, if the key is lost) -> not implemented yet
4. More will be added
