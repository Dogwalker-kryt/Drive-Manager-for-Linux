# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct (v2.1)

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered exclusionary or inappropriate in a professional setting

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project (e.g., on social media, in issue trackers, or in PRs).

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing the standards of acceptable behavior. If you witness or are subject to behavior that violates this code, please report it.

### Reporting

Report any unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers via the repository's Issues or Discussions: https://github.com/Dogwalker-kryt/Drive-Manager-for-Linux/issues

All reports will be handled promptly and with discretion. Reasonable efforts will be made to keep the reporter's identity confidential.

## Enforcement Guidelines

When a report is received, maintainers will evaluate the situation and may take action, including but not limited to:

- A private, documented warning to the offender
- Temporary or permanent removal of contributor privileges
- Reporting to relevant platform authorities if necessary
