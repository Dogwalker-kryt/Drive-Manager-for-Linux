## Coding Style (C++)

- Use **4 spaces or 1 tab** for indentation (just stay consistent)
- Stick to **procedural or minimal OOP** — this project avoids classes unless necessary
- Use **clear, descriptive names** for variables and functions
- Comment your code **only when necessary** — keep comments helpful and to the point
- Use C++ 17 or later
- Try to write self explaining code
- Try to write readable code, so no nesting and such
